# ðŸª¨ Rock, Paper, Scissors â€“ Jac + Gemini AI Edition

This is a minimalistic but smart **Rock, Paper, Scissors game** built using the [Jaseci](https://docs.jaseci.org/) framework and written in **Jac**, a graph-based domain-specific language. 

The twist? It uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash (by Google)** to generate fun and contextual game commentary using the `rps_commentary` LLM function.
